¹ Number of seats according to the [redistribution of seats](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20180126STO94114/eu-elections-how-many-meps-will-each-country-get-in-2019) that was planned for the 2019 European election if the United Kingdom had left the European Union by May 2019.

² No opinion polls reported since the 2014 European election; represented as 1 seat for the EPP.

³ No new opinion polls reported since the last national election; the results from the last national election are therefore used in the current projection for the European election.
